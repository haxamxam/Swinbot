Tensorflow based Chatbot using <strong>Flask, Python and JavaScript </strong>. 

Made as a University Research Project. It is currently deployed on the default WSGI server.

## Here is how to run it:

*Note: Please make sure you have Python 3.6 or 3.7 installed and a virtual environment set up. I used PyCharm as my preferred IDE.*

Install the requirements file

```
pip install requirements.txt
```

Run the application as a Python file

```
python app.py
```

Run the application as a Flask file

Upon successful execution of the code the chatbot will be deployed to a local host at:
